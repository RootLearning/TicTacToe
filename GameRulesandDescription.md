#             Tic-Tac-Toe

## Gameplay

*  This Game is between two players    
*  The goal of tic-tac-toe is to be the first player (or) second player to get three in a row on a 3-by-3 grid.
*  In the 3-by-3 grid game,the player who is playing **X** always goes first. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the board until either player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally or until all squares on the grid are filled.
*  If a player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in a row, then that player wins. If all squares are filled and neither player has made a complete row of Xs or Os, then the game is a draw. 

## Other Variants

* Tic-tac-toe can be also be played on a 5-by-5 grid with each player trying to get five in a row.

* The game can also be played on larger grids, such as 10-by-10 or even 20-by-20. For any grid of 6-by-6 or greater, it might be best to make your goal to get five in a row. This turns the basic game of tic-tac-toe into a much more complex game with similarities to the board game Pente, meaning "five" in Greek. Similarly, the goal of Pente is for a player to score five marks in a row.
